          	<strong>FAQ 1: Why publish a paper if the work is already published as a preprint?</strong>
         	  In the present reward system, journal publications influence funding and promotion decisions; the vast majority of research-paper preprints in physics are therefore <a href="http://asapbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hhmi_feb16.pdf"> also submitted to journals</a>. Journals provide additional services including:
           	   	<li>Peer review</li>
           	   	<li>Increased visibility</li>
          	   	<li>Editorial control and standards</li>
           	   	<li>Branding and marketing</li>
             	<strong>FAQ 2: Will someone steal my work in my preprint?</strong>
			<li>Based on experiences at very established (e.g., ArXiv) and newer, but rapidly growing preprint services (e.g. BiorXiv, SocArXiv), there is no clear evidence that preprints lead to being scooped.</li>
			<li>If someone is prepared to steal ideas from a timestamped/’DOI’d’ preprint, they would likely do the same from material in a journal or from a conference presentation.</li>
			<li>The reputational damage associated with intellectual theft and plagiarism is significant and long-lasting; thus the latter is very rare.</li>
	    	<strong>FAQ 3: Will preprints lead to large volumes of  low-quality material on paleorXiv?</strong>
			<li>Anecdotal evidence suggests this behaviour has not emerged in the communities that use the arXiv.</li>
			<li>Because preprinting requires public disclosure, authors are wary of developing a bad reputation. If the work is poor, it will likely be ignored by the rest of the community. The same applies to material published in any journal.</li>
			<li>RSS feeds allow sorting of material in paleorXiv; cf. Google Scholar.</li>
			<li>Initial evidence and download statistics suggests paleorXiv is hosting high-quality, desirable material.</li>
	   	<strong>FAQ 4: Can paleorXiv host only preprints?</strong>
			<li>No. paleorXiv is also a repository for postprints (i.e. material already published in a journal).</li>
			<li>Depending on journal policy, we can host the Author Accepted Manuscript (i.e. accepted version of paper, but before publisher typesetting) (AAMs) or the Version of Record (VoR) (i.e. published version of paper, after publisher typesetting).</li>
			<li>Check your journal’s policy on self-archiving <a href="https://paleorxiv.github.io/journal_policies.html"> using paleorXiv's database</a></li>
			<li>PaleorXiv can also host datasets, textbooks, book chapters, etc. Please contact us if you have any queries!</li>
		<strong>FAQ 5: Will publishing a preprint mean I can’t publish in a journal?</strong>
			<li>In most cases, the answer is ‘no’.</li>
			<li>Use of preprints has been ongoing in other disciplines for, in some cases, a few decades, many publishers have preprint-friendly policies already in place for their journals.</li>
			<li>Again, please check your journal’s policy on our database <a href="https://paleorxiv.github.io/journal_policies.html"> here</a> for more information.</li>
			<li>Check before you submit - if you’re unsure, ask!</li>
		<strong>FAQ 6: How do I link data to my preprint?</strong>
			<li><a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework’s</a> infrastructure allows for an unlimited amount of space for direct uploading of publication-related data, but limited to 5GB per file.</li>
			<li>More commonly, data, and especially large volumes of data, are stored on external sites (e.g. Dropbox, GitHub, figshare, Google Drive) and linked back to the related preprint/postprint.</li>
			<li>More information on connecting these services via the OSF can be found <a href="http://help.osf.io/m/addons/l/524148-connect-add-ons"> here</a>.</li>
		<strong>FAQ 7: Does my preprint get a DOI and how might this impact citation count?</strong>	
			<li>Preprints are minted with a DOI upon submission, which will persist even if the research is eventually published in a journal.</li>
			<li>Preprints can collect citations, which count towards your h-Index.</li>
			<li>Citations could, in theory, be split between preprints and the VoR.</li>
			<li>The solution is to aggregate the citations through Google Scholar.</li>
			<li>Preprints can direct readers to the published version (Version of Record or ‘VoR’) via a DOI; evidence indicates researchers typically cite the latter and not the former.</li>
		<strong>FAQ 8: How do you pronounce paleorXiv?</strong>
			Short answer: "Paleo-archive". This pronounciation is to honour the arXiv ("archive"), the model of which paleorXiv is based on.
		<strong>FAQ 9: What can I post to paleorXiv?</strong>
			Although engrXiv is part of the <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/"> Open Science Framework Preprints service</a>, we host academic research at a number of stages in the research process:
			<li>Working papers: Any draft of a paper that is ready to share with interested parties, but has not yet been peer reviewed. If you are sharing your work with a group of colleagues, a conference, or a journal, this may be the perfect time to widen the circle and post it on paleoXiv.</li>
			<li>Preprints: Most people use this term to refer to completed papers that have not yet been peer reviewed (like working papers), and typically at some stage within the submission/publication process at a journal. However you define preprints, paleorXiv will host them.</li>
			<li>Postprints: After a paper has been published by a journal (or accepted for publication), this is a version that you elect to share on our open platform. It may be a version that does not include the journal’s formatting or other changes, but has undergone peer review. This is the version you share when you’ve published something but it’s behind a paywall and you want anyone to be able to read it.</li>
