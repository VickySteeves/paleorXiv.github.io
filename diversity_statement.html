      			<br/><h4>paleorXiv Diversity Statement</h4>
                       
		<p style="text-align: justify;">Capturing a broad spectrum of interest and experiences will help paleorXiv consider and include the full Paleontology community. An essential step to achieving this objective is to ensure broad and intersectional diversity in staffing its Steering Committee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paleontology research is conducted by people of a diverse range of demographics and psychographics, including gender identities, sexual orientations, racial and cultural backgrounds, abilities, religions, ages, career stages and fields, and socioeconomic and immigration statuses. These intersectional identities impact on how research is conducted, data analyzed, and results shared. We recognize that a diverse and inclusive scientific community asks a broader range of questions yet also faces different barriers to participating in Paleontology. By listening to diverse voices, we will be rewarded by a greater understanding of our world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an effort to represent and include the broadest possible spectrum of geoscientists, paleoarXiv is committed to the following objectives in forming its Steering Committee:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FIELD: We will aim to include representatives from a broad spectrum of Paleontology fields such as invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology and paleobiology, paleoecology, paleobotany, paleohistology, paleogeography, paleoclimatology, paleobiogeography, and biostratigraphy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GENDER IDENTITY: We will strive for gender parity in our Steering Committee, with awareness of the need for flexibility to include transgender and gender-fluid people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND: We will strive to include a broad range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds in our Advisory Council, with particular focus on traditionally excluded populations including Asian, black, indigenous, Pacific island, and Latin scientists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GEOGRAPHY: We will respect the global nature of the geoscience community by aiming for an equal split of representatives from or working in Europe, North America, Asia, and the rest of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CAREER: We will aim to have at least one representative each from key stages within academia including students; early-, mid-, and late-career professors; researchers at teaching-centric and research-centric universities; and independent scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ABILITY: We will aim to include representatives with a broad range of physical and mental abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NEURODIVERSITY: We will aim to include viewpoints from neurodiverse individuals recognising their advantages and skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SEXUAL ORIENTATION: We will aim to include representatives with a broad range of sexual orientations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is our hope that meeting all these objectives within the current 7-person Steering Committee will subsequently include a range of intersectional identities to further enhance our understanding. We recognize that we may not always achieve all of these objectives, and will be as transparent as possible about our effectiveness within the confines of respecting the privacy of our Steering Committee members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also recognize we may not yet be considering all aspects of how identity shapes the science that we do. We further commit to continuing to learn and adapt how we define and include diverse populations in response to the needs of our greater community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are interested in joining the Steering Committee, please contact us <a href="mailto:jon.tennant.2@gmail.com">here</a>.</p>
